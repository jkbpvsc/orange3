Scripting in Orange: A Tutorial
===============================

This is a gentle introduction on scripting in `Orange <http://orange.biolab.si>`_ , a Python 3 data mining library. We here assume you have already downloaded and installed Orange from its `github repository <https://github.com/biolab/orange3>`_ and have a working version of Python. In the command line or any Python environment, try to import Orange. Below, we used a Python shell::

   % python
   >>> import Orange
   >>> Orange.version.version
   '3.2.dev0+8907f35'
   >>>

If this leaves no error and warning, Orange and Python are properly installed and you are ready to continue with the Tutorial.
