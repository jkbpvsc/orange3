**Bug reports that do not sufficiently describe a bug are not helpful and will most likely be ignored.**

- [ ] **A clear and concise description.** "*I'm getting an error when I open a tree viewer*" is far from enough (what kind of error? what kind of data you give it?). "*I'm getting an error*" is even worse.

- [ ] **How to reproduce the problem.** Upload a zip with a workflow and data, or describe the steps (open this widget, click there, then add this ...)

- [ ] **Which version of Orange are you using? How did you install it?**

- [ ] **What is your operating system?**
